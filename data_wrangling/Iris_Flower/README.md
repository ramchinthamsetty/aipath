This is a very basic tutorial for exploratory data analyis and data visualization using the '[Iris Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)'

The Iris data set is best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Before moving to machine learning for pattern learning, we will perform EDA and visualize the data set.

The data set consists of 150 observations with 4 features - Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length and Petal width, of three different species - Setosa, Versicolar and Virginica.

We'll use two libraries for this tutorial: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
